## Gifts
Find our registries at the following partner websites! With your help, we won't be bickering about why we can't make that one delicious coffee cake. Because we will have that amazing stand mixer we've always wanted, and a superb coffee grinder that can pulverize a bean into coarse or fine grains of uniform size. And dare I wish, an espresso machine that can then take that grind and churn out a mean shot of espresso?

## Paper
However, if you find that nothing really suits you on our registry, there is still a way to help us get started on our journey together! Because what good are gifts from the registry if there is no home to put them in?

We are beginning to save up towards our first home, and with your help, we can make that dream a reality. We would love to receive a donation towards our first downpayment on a house, and with your support, hope to have one less thing to worry about when the time comes to sign our life away to a mortgage.
